# Soph-E

Project for yuHacks that aims to facilitate online learning by bringing to Discord features that might be useful in users' daily study routine. We believe that by taking advantage of the familiarity students have with Discord and use it as a way to improve their academic performance represents a great opportunity and Soph-E is here to explore it.
